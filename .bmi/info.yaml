summary: ROMS is a Free-surface, terrain-following, orthogonal curvilinear,
  primitive equations ocean model. Its dynamical kernel is comprised of
  four separate models including the nonlinear, tangent linear, representer
  tangent linear, and adjoint models. It has multiple model coupling (ESMF,
  MCT) and multiple grid nesting (composed, mosaics, refinement)
  capabilities. The code uses a coarse-grained parallelization with both
  shared-memory (OpenMP) and distributed-memory (MPI) paradigms coexisting
  together and activated via C-preprocessing.
